# CurrencyCoverter
Simple currency converter powered by Exchange Rate API 

The converter is presented in an HTML file with input for the amount to be converted and output fields for exchange rate and conversion result.
It also has two buttons, one to convert the amount and another to reset all fields.

Makes use of JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate DOM and event handling. 
It uses an AJAX jquery $.ajax function to make an asynchronous HTTP request and incorporates error handling in the fetchData function.

The styling is made using CSS Bootstrap in an external script.

Future version will include selectable currency.
